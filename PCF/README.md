The name PCF stands for "Programming Computable Functions." It's a theoretical programming language that was made by Dana Scott during the 1960s. 

PCF has qualities that are usual in functional programming languages. It has first-class functions, higher-order functions and a way for recursion. It is strongly typed and supports a basic type system having function types included within it. The most significant part of PCF is the fixed-point operators which make possible to define recursive functions.

PCF has greatly impacted the progress of type theory and the structure of later functional languages. It acts as a groundwork for studying denotational semantics in programming languages, where we interpret every construction as a mathematical item.

This version of PCF is taken from Streicher's Domain Theory book.
